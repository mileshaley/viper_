viper_
=====
```cpp
"viper"_ = "An attempt to replicate Python's syntax in C++"; 
```
----

The goal of viper_ is to leverage as many C++ language features as possible to replicate the **clean syntax** and **dynamic typing** of python.

This project isn't designed to be used seriously but instead as a fun demonstration of the useful (and obscure) features C++ has to offer.

`viper_.h` is the single include header file that requires no setup.
